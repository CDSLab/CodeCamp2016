We all lead busy lives, so it can be a challenge to find timely and relevant information. But what if you had a personal assistant to deliver this for you? In this lab, you will build your own cognitive cloud app powered by IBM Watson to deliver news and weather customized for your preferences and location. You will build your own Node.js application deployed to IBM Bluemix and use services from the Watson Alchemy News and the Weather Company. News articles are analyzed for category and sentiment and a real-time weather forecast is delivered for your location. Your assistant will speak to you with Watson text-to-speech technology, or can tweet your report. In the process, you will also learn more about Node-RED, Node.js and Bluemix.
